# Body Pose Annotator

The **Body Pose Annotator** app is a handy desktop app for seamless Vision analysis of body, hand and face landmarks for applied tasks such as sign language recognition, action classification, and more. The app makes it easy to annotate both single videos and large datasets, and output the data in a standardized CSV file for any further work.

## Usage

The app has two main ways for annotation â€“ either from single videos, or from full datasets. Either way, please ensure that all of your videos are in the `.mp4` format.

### Single video

To annotate a single video, simply select the **Annotate video** section in the left navigation bar. Then either drag-and-drop your file, or select it using the **Load Video** button. Then start the analysis using the **Start processing** button. Once the analysis is finished, you will be prompted with an alert view to save the resulting `.csv` file.

### Full dataset

To annotate a full dataset, ensure that you have a dataset folder with structured folders of the individual labels and the videos inside them. There should also be no other files irrelevant to the analysis. Then select the **Annotate dataset** section in the left navigation bar and either drag-and-drop your folder, or select it using the **Load Dataset** button. You can start the analysis using the **Start processing** button. Once the analysis is finished, you will be prompted with an alert view to save the resulting `.csv` file.
